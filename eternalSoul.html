      <h2>Mammon Kingdom, 1333 AD</h2>
      <p>
	  Local peasant, Amrita Magnadyne, finds herself on death row for 
	  thievery, sentenced to execution by guillotine. One by one, the 
	  prisoners are condemned by the priest and slaughtered. Eventually, 
	  Rita is placed in the guillotine. However, just as the blade descends, 
	  a blinding light erupts from the cathedral's stained glass.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Moments later, Rita awakens to find herself alive and outside the 
	  guillotine. A hellscape lies around her. All of the townsfolk mutilated. 
	  With the castle's entrance locked behind her and many questions to be 
	  answered, she ventures inside.

      <p>
	  A large castle awaits you. Find your way through to reach Father Rorschach, 
	  though the journey won't be so easy. Many rooms stand between you and him. 
	  Which contain demons, secret passages, and Rorschach's followers. If you fail, 
	  you can always try again. Amaranth Death will revive you at the last save point 
	  you visited.

	  Grow stronger as you progress by leveling up, obtaining better equipment, 
	  finding better weapons, and taking more powerful souls. Interact with various

      <h2>A litany of beasts roam within the castle</h2>
      <p>
	  Many demons reside within the castle, persisting without hosts under Rorschach's 
	  influence. However, the souls they provide can be simplified into four main types.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  <p>
	  <b>MANIFEST :</b>
	  Manifest souls create some type of physical  manifestation. These generally form 
	  projectile attacks such as fire balls, knives, bullets, etc. These are created 
	  instantaneously by pressing a button. Additionally, the only limit to how many 
	  can be made is how much energy you have left.
	  </p>
	  

	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  <p>
	  <b>AUGMENT :</b>
	  Augment souls provide some type of alteration to the player. Such as a stat boost, 
	  transformation, or manipulation. Depending on the augment, a button must be held 
	  to maintain it or pressed to toggle it.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  <p>
	  <b>GUARDIAN :</b>
	  Guardian souls summon the demon itself to fight on your behalf. They can be set as 
	  completely autonomous (SENTIENT) or only acting when commanded (COMMAND). These are 
	  the most powerful and fierce but the most demanding on your energy supply.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  <p>
	  <b>PASSIVE :</b>
	  Passive souls provide a constant effect at no energy cost. These range from stat 
	  boosts to permanent abilities. These souls can be enabled/disabled inside the 
	  player's inventory. Ability-based passive souls are accessed with unique button 
	  combos. Ex: hold down and press attack while in the air.

	</p></li>
	<br>
	<h2>Sickle Attacks</h2>
	<li><p>
	  Sickles provide fast, weak attacks that can be jump canceled. You can 
	  effectively attack more quickly by repeating jump attacking and landing. 
	  With such a short reach, you'll be required to get closer to enemies.

      <h2 class="text-center">See what it does before you equip it</h2>
      <p>
	  Have you ever gotten a weapon with mediocre stats but a powerful secret? A weapon most 
	  players would shrug off without trying because, "Eh, it does less damage than my current 
	  one." If this were Symphony of the Night, that would be the Crissaegrim or Valmanway. 
	  Well, no more! Immediately view what a weapon does from your inventory without needing 
	  to equip it.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  This applies to the souls of demons as well. Open your inventory and watch the soul's 
	  ability play out without having to equip it or, more importantly, waste any energy on 
	  using it. View the soul's precise stats and capabilities. Does the manifest pierce 
	  enemies? Does the augment lock me in one place? How much damage does the guardian do 
	  in a second?

	<h3 class="w3-border-bottom text-center w3-border-light-grey">Demo</h3>
      <h2 class="text-center">Coming soon!</h2>
      <p>
	  Q: Why is the demo not ready? The game looks playable to me.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  A: Because I'm not releasing anything half-baked. Right now, there are only 
	  a select handful of rooms done. There is one large room that I need to finish 
	  first. Making artwork for these rooms is a slow process for me. And the room in 
	  question is massive. Approximately 3x3 map squares (3 * 240 = 720 pixels) by 
	  (3 * 320 = 960 pixels). Once I finish this room and touch up the connected rooms, 
	  I should have a demo ready.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
	  Q: How will the demo be released?
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  A: I'll have a 32-bit and 64-bit Windows .exe download available. Since I 
	  program on a Windows PC, it is the easiest version to test. Additionally, 
	  I plan to include an HTML5/JS version here on the website. Both will run at 
	  60 FPS. I may also do a macOS version
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
	  Q: Can I view the source code?
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  A: Sorry, but no. I have no plans to make the game's source code public.
