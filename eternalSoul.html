      <h2>Mammon Kingdom, 1333 AD</h2>
      <p>
	  Local peasant, Amrita Magnadyne, finds herself on death row for thievery, sentenced to execution by guillotine. 
	  One by one the prisoners are condemned by the priest, and slaughtered. Eventually, Rita is placed in the guilltone. 
	  However, just as the blade descends, a blinding light erupts from the cathedral stained glass.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Moments later Rita awakens to find herself alive, and outside of the guillotine. A hellscape lies around her. All of the townsfolk
	  mutilated. With the entrance gate to the castle locked behind her, and many strange questions to be answer,
	  she ventures inside the castle.

      <h2>A litany of beasts roam within the castle</h2>
      <p>
	  Many demons reside within the castle, persisting without hosts under Rorschach's influence.
	  However, the souls they provide can be simplified down into four main types.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  <p>
	  <b>MANIFEST :</b>
	  Manifest souls create some type of physcial manifestation. These generally form projectile attacks
	  such as a fire balls, knives, bullets, etc. These are created instantaniously by pressing a button.
	  Additionally, the only limit to how many can be created is how much energy you have left.
	  </p>
	  

	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  <p>
	  <b>AUGMENT :</b>
	  Augment souls provide some type of alteration to the player. Such as a stat boost, transformation,
	  or manipulation. These souls are either kept active by holding a button, or toggling
	  then on and off with a button press.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  <p>
	  <b>GUARDIAN :</b>
	  Guardian souls summon the demon itself to fight on your behalf. They can be set as completely autonomous (SENTIENT)
	  or only acting when commanded to do so (COMMAND). These are by far the most powerful and fierce, but also the most
	  demanding on your energy supply.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <br>
	  
	  <p>
	  <b>PASSIVE :</b>
	  Passive souls provide a constant effect at no energy cost. These range from stat boosts to
	  permanent abilities. These souls can be enabled / disabled at anytime inside the player's inventory.
	  The abilities are accessed with unique button combos. Ex: hold down and press attack while in the air.

	  ensures you'll hit something.
	</p></li>
	<br>
	<h2>Sickle Attacks</h2>
	<li><p>
	  Sickles provide weak attacks that are fast. These attacks can be jump cancelled.
	  By repeating jump attacking and landing you can get out more attacks faster.
	  Though with such a short reach you'll be required to get closer to enemies.

      <h2 class="text-center">See what it does before you equip it</h2>
      <p>
	  Have you ever gotten a weapon that had medicore stats but a powerful secret? A weapon
	  most players would shrug off without trying because "Eh, it does less damage than my 
	  current one". If this were Symphony of the Night, that would be the Crissaegrim or Valmanway.
	  Well no more! Immediately view what a weapon does from your inventory without needing to equip it.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  This applies to the souls of demons as well. Open your inventory and watch the soul's ability
	  play out without having to equip it, or more importantly, waste any energy on using it. View the soul's
	  precise stats and capabilities. Does the manifest pierce enemies? Does the augment lock me in one place?
	  How much damage does the guardian do in a second?

      <p>
	  Q: Why is the demo not ready? The game looks playable to me.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  A: Because I'm not releasing anything half baked. Right now there are only
	  a select handful of rooms done. There is one large room that I need to finish first. Making
	  artwork for these rooms is a slow process for me. Once I finish the
	  central room of the cathedral and touch up the connected rooms I should have a demo ready.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
	  Q: How will the demo be released?
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  A: I'll have a 32-bit and 64-bit Windows .exe download available. Since I program
	  on a Windows PC it is the easiest version to test. Additionally I plan to include an HTML5/JS 
	  version here on the website. Both will run at 60 FPS. I may also do a macOS version.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
	  Q: Can I view the source code?
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  A: Sorry but no. I have no plans to make the game's source code public.
