      <h2>Faithfully Recreated</h2>
      <p>
	  Scripted Spy Cards is a recreation of the minigame from Bug Fables, made playable 
	  inside Tabletop Simulator. Create a deck of 15 cards (1 boss card, 2 mini-boss cards, 
	  and 12 enemy cards). Mix and match cards or focus on a single tribe. There are many 
	  ways to create your deck and win. Once you've built your deck, you can save it and 
	  begin battling your friends online.

      <h2>Or spectate</h2>
      <p>
	  Once you create a room in Tabletop Simulator, you can invite up to eight 
	  friends. Two battling and six spectating. The two battling one another 
	  can't peek at the cards in the other's hand. They'll only show their face 
	  once placed down. However, spectators can see both players' cards at all 
	  times. Whether they're still being held or have been placed.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
	  Once a competing player is ready, they press their corresponding button to 
	  ready up. Once both players are ready, the cards will lock, and the round begins.
	  </p>

	  <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey">Let The Round Begin</h3>
      <h2>Sit back and watch</h2>
      <p>
	  Once the round begins, the game will automatically start moving the cards, 
	  calculating attack and defense, applying effects, and more. Once the round 
	  is over, the loser will lose one health point. Cards are then collected, 
	  held, and redistributed throughout the match. So think twice before placing 
	  that valuable boss card. The game's "Auto-Dealer" will be holding onto it 
	  for a while before you get it back.

      <h2>Pseudo dev-log</h2>
      <p>
	  This project only happened because my friend thought it would be fun to play the 
	  Spy Cards minigame from Bug Fables online with friends. In Bug Fables, the card game 
	  would only be played with a few NPCs, hence being a minigame. I figured Tabletop Simulator 
	  would be a great fit, so I set out to learn how to make mods in it. And how to program in Lua.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
	  There were many strange roadblocks I had to overcome. For example, some cards will summon 
	  (created from thin air) other cards to be played in the same round. This wasn't easy to incorporate, 
	  but I eventually got it to work. Annoyingly I never found a way to actually summon a card from nothing. 
	  Tabletop Simulator was very restrictive with what your Lua code could do. The one solution I found was 
	  to have locked template cards copied when a card had to be summoned.
	  </p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
	  Overall, I enjoyed working on this and finally playing Spy Cards online with my friend. It turned out 
	  well; logically, it was a one-to-one match with Bug Fables. Both versions played identically. This is 
	  especially great since I didn't have access to the source code and had to figure out the logic through 
	  trial and error. This card game may seem simple, but it can get very complicated.
